# Marketing-A/B-testing

Marketing campaigns operate in a dynamic environment where multiple strategies can lead to success. To optimize decision-making, companies often use A/B testing, a randomized experimentation process where different versions of a variable (e.g., a webpage, banner, or ad) are shown to separate user groups to measure their impact on key business metrics.

This dataset is designed to help answer two critical questions:

Would the campaign be successful?
If the campaign is successful, how much of that success can be attributed to the ads?
To investigate this, an A/B test is conducted:

The experimental group is exposed to the actual advertisements.
The control group sees either a Public Service Announcement (PSA) or no ad at all, ensuring a baseline comparison.
